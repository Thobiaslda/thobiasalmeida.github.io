        <h1>Case Study: Social Listening & Community Relations</h1>
        <p class="case-intro">A strategic project for a <strong>Mining & Logistics Company</strong> to diagnose community doubts and concerns regarding a new railway terminal, forming the basis for effective dialogue and relationship-building.</p>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>A major infrastructure project was stalled by intense but poorly understood community opposition. The company's dialogue efforts were failing because they were responding to symptoms, not the root causes of public distrust, which were fueled by misinformation and fear about environmental and social impacts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I designed and led a qualitative research project to move beyond assumptions and gather direct, unfiltered community feedback. The methodology included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Interviews:</strong> Conducted face-to-face and virtual interviews with 31 people living in the immediate vicinity of the project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Qualitative Data Synthesis:</strong> Transformed hours of conversation into clear, thematic findings, identifying word clouds of core concerns (e.g., "Dust," "Noise," "Water," "Negative") and perceptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stakeholder Mapping:</strong> Identified a structured opposition group with media connections and analyzed the "NIMBY" (Not In My Backyard) sentiment contaminating the project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actionable Reporting:</strong> Presented the findings not just as problems, but as a clear roadmap for communication, complete with specific recommendations to build trust and mitigate reputational damage.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
