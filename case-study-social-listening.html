                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>A major infrastructure project was facing significant community opposition driven by misinformation and fear. The client, J. Mendes, needed to understand the root causes of the negative sentiment before they could establish a productive dialogue with local stakeholders.</p>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h2>My Approach & Key Findings</h2>
                <p>I designed and executed a social listening project involving face-to-face and virtual interviews with 31 people in the project's vicinity. The goal was to record unfiltered doubts and concerns. The findings were stark:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> 46% of residents were completely unaware of the project's details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Perception:</strong> Of those who had heard of the company, most had a negative view fueled by rumors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Core Concerns:</strong> The primary fears revolved around environmental impacts (dust, water pollution), noise, and increased traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Stakeholders:</strong> We identified a structured opposition group with media connections, creating a climate of distrust.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

             <div class="case-section">
                <h2>Strategic Recommendations & Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Based on these findings, I provided a clear set of recommendations, including defining a "tone of voice" for dialogue, presenting environmental studies in accessible language, and establishing a permanent forum for monitoring the project. This case highlights my ability to use research and social listening as a foundation for building effective, trust-based community relations and crisis prevention strategies.</p>
